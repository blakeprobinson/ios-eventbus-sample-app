App to test the basic functionality of EventBus (https://github.com/regexident/EventBus)

Since I ran into some issues the sample app for EventBus (https://github.com/regexident/EventBus), I went ahead and created this app as a substitute.

It has three events, two of which have delegates that listen to the events and are notified about them. 

There's a basic UI that let's you start the process of events, view the events getting triggered, and reset the process.
